This is a simple example on how to build a Google Chrome extension to evaluate a website's responsiveness with multiple frames with different dimensions.

How to install the extension on Google Chrome
---------------------------------------------

 * Clone this repository
 * In Google Chrome go to chrome://extensions/
 * If the `Load unpacked extension...` button is not showing, click the `Developer mode` option on top. This should bring the `Load unpacked extension...` button
 * Click the `Load unpacked extension...` button and choose the extension directory

You can set up a keyboard shortcut by scrolling all the way down to the bottom of the extensions page and click the "Keyboard shortcuts" link.
